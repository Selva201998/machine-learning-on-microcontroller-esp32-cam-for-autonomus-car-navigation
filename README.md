# Project Overview

Moreover, a distinctive approach to this project involves a comparative analysis of the computational capabilities and performance between the micro-controller-based system and conventional computer setups. By undertaking this comparison, we aim to shed light on the practicality and feasibility of micro-controller technology for real-world navigation scenarios, thereby offering crucial insights into the potential of our hypothesis-driven approach.

## Hypotheses

1. **Hypothesis 1:** We hypothesize that the integration of machine learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), with the ESP32 CAM micro-controller will enable real-time object recognition and obstacle avoidance, contributing to enhanced autonomous navigation capabilities.

2. **Hypothesis 2:** We posit that the optimization of machine learning models for the ESP32 CAM micro-controller, achieved through techniques like quantization and pruning, will result in a significant reduction in memory usage without compromising navigation accuracy.

3. **Hypothesis 3:** It is our hypothesis that the utilization of the ESP32 CAM micro-controller's low power consumption capabilities will lead to an energy-efficient autonomous vehicle system, making it suitable for prolonged operation in resource-constrained environments.

4. **Hypothesis 4:** We anticipate that the comparative analysis between micro-controller-based systems and traditional computers will reveal the ESP32 CAM microcontrollerâ€™s suitability for cost-effective and efficient autonomous navigation, potentially revolutionizing the landscape of autonomous vehicle technology.
